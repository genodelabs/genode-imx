This directory contains a port of the Linux DRM driver 'etnaviv' for
Vivante GC7000L GPUs.

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

There is no policy management implemented and therefore each connecting
client is allowed to use the service. Furthermore the 'Gpu' session does not
make use of accounting mechanisms, the driver has to provide all the resources
the client may need.


Usage
~~~~~

The driver will announce the 'Gpu' service after it successfully initialized
the GPU.

To start the driver the following configuration snippet can be used:

!<start name="imx8mq_gpu" caps="500" ram="128M">
!  <provides> <service name="Gpu"/> </provides>
!  </config/>
!</start>

Additionally there exists the 'dtb' attribute in the '<config> node
that may be used to specify the name of the DTB ROM module, e.g.:

! <config dtb="imx8mq_gpu-imx8q_evk.dtb"/>
